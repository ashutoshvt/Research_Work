4/27/2016  Remarks to Ashutosh

The "Computational Details" section must provide enough details such that
others could reproduce the work.  In that regard, I note some things that are
missing:

(1) What geometries were used?  These should be provided explicitly for all
the systems in the SI.  See the SI for Harley's paper on CPL for a good
example:

http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00845

(2) What theoretical methods?  CC2?  CCSD?  

(3) Were core orbitals frozen?

(4) No references are given to methods or basis sets in this section.

(5) Need a better explanation for the reason we use "ghosted" basis functions
--- and exactly what we mean by that term.

(6) I also note that "Dunning" is a proper noun and should be capitalized.

Notes on intro re-write

\cite{Landau10}:

Landau {\em et al.}\ applied the frozen natural orbital approach to the equation-of-motion coupled cluster method for
ionized states (EOM-IP-CC) and found that a reduction of the virtual space of up to 70% yielded truncation errors within
ca.\ 1 kcal/mol for ionization energies of organic compounds and non-parallelity errors in potential surfaces of weakly
bound complexes.

They used two critieria for truncation: the percentage of virtual orbitals (POVO) and occupation threshold (OCCT)
cutoffs.  The former is simply the fraction of virtual orbitals removed, while the latter is the percentage of total
natural virtual orbital occupation retained.  Errors in the IEs decreased linearly with OCCT, but not with POVO.  This
allowed them to predict problematic cases.

TODO: Do the CC, Lambda, and/or perturbed wave function equations converge more slowly in the truncated FVNO basis?

TODO: We need to re-examine our data using the OCCT criteria.

In the construction of many-body electronic wave functions, the scaling of a
given method with the number of molecular orbitals (MOs) plays a pivotal role
in the ultimate cost of the calculation.  For many-body methods such as
coupled cluster (CC),\cite{Shavitt09,Gauss98,Crawford00:review} which, in its
canonical formulation, displays a higher-order polynomial dependence on the
number of MOs, numerous mechanisms have been explored over the last half
century for reducing the size of the virtual-MO space.  Among the earliest of
these was L{\"o}wdin's\cite{Lowdin55} introduction in 1955 of the concept of
``natural orbitals'' (NOs) --- orbitals for which the one-electron density
matrix is diagonal.  L\"owdin demonstrated that NOs yield faster convergence
of the CI wave function expansion than Hartree-Fock MOs.  Some years later,
Bender and Davidson\cite{Bender69} used natural orbitals in conjunction with
CI (NO-CI) calculations to construct and analyze the most important
configurations contributing to the correlated wave functions for a series of
closed- and open-shell first-row diatomic hydrides.  This work motivated Barr
and Davidson a year later\cite{Barr70} to utilize only the virtual natural
orbitals, obtained obtained by diagonalization of the virtual-virtual block of
the one-electron density matrix, for NO-CI calculations on the Ne atom.

The concept of pair natural orbitals (PNOs -- originally called
``pseudonatural orbitals'') was developed by Edmiston and
Krauss,\cite{Edmiston66} by Meyer\cite{Meyer73}, and by Ahlrichs and
co-workers.\cite{Ahlrichs75} In the PNO approach, the virtual-virtual MO block
of the one-electron density is constructed and diagonalized independently for
each occupied MO pair, leading to separate non-orthogonal virtual spaces.
Although this approach leads to rapid convergence of the correlation energy
with respect to the size of the virtual space, it was little used following
initial investigations until it was resurrected in recent years by Neese and
co-workers with great success in the context of reduced-scaling electron
correlation methods.\cite{Neese09,Riplinger16}

Following these pioneering efforts, NOs have been exploited in numerous
applications to construct compact CI,\cite{Fermann94,Sherrill98:CI,Abrams04}
multiconfigurational self-consistent-field (MCSCF),\cite{Jensen88} and coupled
cluster (CC) wave
functions.\cite{Sosa89,Taube05,Taube08,Landau10,DePrince13:FNOs,DePrince13} In
many of these studies, the virtual-MO block of the one-electron density is
first obtained from a simpler model, such as second-order many-body
perturbation theory (MBPT) calculation, and then diagonalized to yield the
virtual-NO space.  The space is then truncated based on an
occupation-number-related criterion and fixed for the subsequent
correlated-wave-function calculation.  In addition, the final energy is
commonly corrected using the MP2 correlation energy contributions arising from
the non-truncated virtual space.  These studies have indicated that, for
energetics and related properties, even aggressive truncation of the
virtual-NO space often has only a small impact on the resulting property as
compared to full-space computations.  For example, Landau {\em et
al.}\cite{Landau10} found that NOs combined with the equation-of-motion
coupled cluster method for ionized states (EOM-IP-CC), reduction of the
virtual space of up to 70% yielded truncation errors within ca.\ 1 kcal/mol
for ionization energies of organic compounds and non-parallelity errors in
potential surfaces of weakly bound complexes.

While the above studies have demonstrated clearly the usefulness of NOs for
aggressively truncating the virtual space when computing correlation energies,
more complex properties have yet to be considered.  As shown in a number of
recent
reports,\cite{Korona04,Russ04,Russ08,McAlexander12,Friedrich15,McAlexander15:LRCC}
properties that are related to the linear- or higher-order response of the
wave function to external electric and magnetic fields, for example, exhibit
much greater sensitivity to the quality of the wave function than simple
energetics.  In particular, local correlation methods have been
shown\cite{Korona04,Russ04,Russ08,McAlexander12,McAlexander15:LRCC} to
require significantly larger domains for properties such as polarizabilities
than for ground-state energies.  Furthermore, the many-body expansion ---
which has yielded impressive convergence for energetics and dipole moments for
clusters of weakly interacting molecules (such as a solute embedded in an
explicit solvent) --- converges erratically, at best, for spectroscopic
response properties due to its strong basis-set dependence.\cite{Mach14}  In order to
account for this, the ability to reduce the dimensionality of the virtual
space becomes paramount.  Thus, the focus of the present work is on the
extension of the NO approach to linear-response properties, especially the
cases of ferquency-dependent dipole polarizabilities and optical rotations of
chiral compounds.
