(ABSTRACT)

%\vfill

\end{center}
One of the central problems limiting the application of accurate {\em ab
initio} methods to large molecular systems is their high computational costs,
i.e., their computing and storage requirements exhibit polynomial scaling with
the size of the system.  For example, the coupled cluster method --- the
``gold standard'' of quantum chemistry --- scales as ${\cal O}(N^6)$, where
$N$ is a measure of the system size. Local correlation techniques, however, have 
the potential to alleviate this scaling problem. While these methods have been
quite successful in describing correlation energies they perform rather poorly 
for response properties like dipole polarizabilities and optical rotation. In 
this work, we identify some of the reasons behind the failure of popular
local correlation models like Frozen Virtual Natural Orbitals (FVNO) and Pair Natural
Orbitals (PNO) in capturing the response of the wavefunction. Consequently, we introduce 
novel modifications to these schemes which we call FVNO++ and PNO++ respectively.
Initial results indicate that these techniques significantly outperform their 
conventional counterparts and can be used for calculating response properties 
of large molecular systems.

\chapter{Introduction}
\markright{Ashutosh Kumar \hfill Chapter 1. Introduction \hfill}

Start talking about optical rotation as a property. Science behind this property!!
Points to talk:
1. Some history of optical rotation (MC Tam's thesis)
	a. chirality - same story as my Internal Seminar.
	b. Drug thalidomide example
	c. Chiroptical spectroscopy
	d. Theory as a tool! 
	e. Some history of OR calculations (Harley's thesis)
	f. TD-DFT not enough in most cases, CC needed (known problems of DFT)
	g. Challenges of CC - (mention about MD as well.) 
	h. My work comes in here!
