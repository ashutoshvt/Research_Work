(ABSTRACT)

%\vfill

\end{center}
One of the central problems limiting the application of accurate {\em ab
initio} methods to large molecular systems is their high computational costs,
i.e., their computing and storage requirements exhibit polynomial scaling with
the size of the system. For example, the coupled cluster singles and doubles 
method with the perturbative inclusion of triples: the CCSD(T) model, 
which is considered as the ``gold standard'' of quantum chemistry scales as 
${\cal O}(N^7)$ in its canonical formulation, where $N$ is a measure of the 
system size. However, the steep scaling associated with these methods is 
unphysical since the property of dynamic electron correlation or dispersion 
(for insulators) is local in nature and decay as $R^{-6}$ power of distance. 
Different reduced-scaling techniques which attempt to exploit this inherent 
sparsity in the wavefunction have been used in conjunction with the coupled cluster 
theory to calculate ground-state properties of molecular systems with
hundreds of heavy atoms in reasonable computational time. However, efforts towards
extension of these methods for describing response properties which are related to the 
derivative of the wavefunction with respect to external electric or/and magnetic fields, 
like polarizabilities, optical rotations, etc., have been fairly limited and conventional 
reduced-scaling algorithms have been shown to yield large and often erratic deviations from 
the full canonical results for these properties. In this work, we identify the reasons behind 
the unsatisfactory performance of the pair natural orbital (PNO) based reduced-scaling 
approach for calculating linear response properties at the coupled cluster level of theory 
and propose novel modifications, which we refer to as PNO++, (A. Kumar and T. D. Crawford, 
2018, {\em manuscript in preparation}) that can provide the necessary accuracy at significantly 
lower computational costs. The motivation behind the PNO++ approach comes from our works 
on the (frozen) virtual natural orbitals (FVNO), which can be seen as a precursor to the concept 
of PNOs (A. Kumar and T. D. Crawford, {\em J. Phys. Chem. A}, 2017, {\bf 121(3)}, pp 708-716) and 
the improved FVNO++ method (A. Kumar and T. D. Crawford, 2018, {\em manuscript in 
preparation}). The essence of these modified schemes (FVNO++ and PNO++) lie in finding suitable 
field perturbed one electron densities to construct ``perturbation aware" virtual spaces which,
by construction, are much more compact for calculating response properties, making them ideal
for applications to large molecular systems. \\\\
%The virtual natural orbitals
%In this work, we identify some of the reasons behind  the failure of popular local correlation models like Frozen Virtual Natural Orbitals (FVNO) 
%and Pair Natural Orbitals (PNO) in capturing the response of the wavefunction. 
%Consequently, we introduce  novel modifications to these schemes which we call FVNO++ 
%and PNO++ respectively. Initial results indicate that these techniques 
%significantly outperform their conventional counterparts and can be used for 
%calculating response properties of large molecular systems.
