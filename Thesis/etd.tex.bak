(ABSTRACT)

%\vfill

\end{center}
One of the central problems limiting the application of accurate {\em ab
initio} methods to large molecular systems is their high computational costs,
i.e., their computing and storage requirements exhibit polynomial scaling with
the size of the system. For example, the coupled cluster singles and doubles 
method with the perturbative inclusion of triples: the CCSD(T) model, 
which is considered to be the ``gold standard'' of quantum chemistry scales as 
${\cal O}(N^7)$ in its canonical formulation, where $N$ is a measure of the 
system size. However, the steep scaling associated with these methods is 
unphysical since the property of dynamic electron correlation or dispersion 
(for insulators) is local in nature and decays as $R^{-6}$ power of distance. 
Different reduced-scaling techniques which attempt to exploit this inherent 
sparsity in the wavefunction have been used in conjunction with the coupled cluster 
theory to calculate ground-state properties of molecular systems with hundreds of heavy atoms in reasonable computational time. 
However, efforts towards extension of these methods for describing response properties like polarizabilities, optical rotations, 
etc., which are related to the derivative of the wavefunction with respect to external electric or/and magnetic fields,
have been fairly limited and conventional reduced-scaling algorithms have been shown to yield large and often erratic deviations from 
the full canonical results. In this work, we identify the reasons behind 
the unsatisfactory performance of the pair natural orbital (PNO) based reduced-scaling 
approach for calculating linear response properties at the coupled cluster level of theory 
and propose novel modifications, which we refer to as PNO++, (A. Kumar and T. D. Crawford. Perturbed Pair 
Natural Orbitals for Coupled-Cluster Linear-Response Theory. 2018, {\em manuscript in preparation}) 
that can provide the necessary accuracy at significantly lower computational costs. The motivation 
behind the PNO++ approach came from our works on the (frozen) virtual natural orbitals (FVNO), which can 
be seen as a precursor to the concept of PNOs (A. Kumar and T. D. Crawford. Frozen Virtual Natural Orbitals for 
Coupled-Cluster Linear-Response Theory. {\em J. Phys. Chem. A}, 2017, 121(3), pp 708-716) and the improved 
FVNO++ method (A. Kumar and T. D. Crawford. Perturbed Natural Orbitals for Coupled-Cluster Linear-Response 
Theory. 2018, {\em manuscript in preparation}). The essence of these modified schemes (FVNO++ and PNO++) lie in finding suitable 
field perturbed one-electron densities to construct ``perturbation aware" virtual spaces which,
by construction, are much more compact for describing response properties, making them ideal
for applications on large molecular systems.\\\\

%One of the major applications of quantum mechanics

%
Since its inception, quantum mechanics has been widely used by theoretical chemists 
to study, model and predict a variety of molecular properties and reactions accurately
and reliably. Central to the field of quantum mechanics is the Schrodinger’s equation, %proposed by Erwin 
%Schrodinger in 1926 or the Schrodinger’s equation, 
whose exact solution is only known for one electron systems.
%which can be only solved exactly for only one electron systems.
As such, numerous quantum mechanical models have been proposed over the years in an
attempt to solve the many body Schrodinger equation approximately. A very good
example in this regard is the coupled cluster (CC) family of methods wherein the CCSD(T) model is 
considered as the ``gold standard" of quantum chemistry due to its high accuracy. However, one major 
bottleneck which prevents the use of accurate CC models to study biological systems which routinely involve 
hundreds of atoms, is the issue of high computational expenses. For example, doubling the system size in a 
CCSD(T) calculation can lead to a 64 times increase in the computational costs, which limits the application of this model
to systems with 10 to 20 atoms. However, this unfavorable scaling with respect to system size is unphysical for 
large molecular systems as inter-electron interactions decay rapidly with distance, or are in other words, 
a local phenomenon. Reduced-scaling methods attempt to exploit this property of locality by finding a compact
representation of the wavefunction. Various reduced-scaling approaches
%To take advantage of this property of locality, various reduced-scaling approaches 
like projected natural orbitals (PNOs), projected atomic orbitals (PAOs) 
%which aim to exploit this property of locality by finding a compact representation 
%of the wavefunction, 
have been proposed and developed over the years which have extended the applicability 
of the CC methods to systems as large as proteins and dna fragments. While these methods have been 
shown to be quite reliable for calculating properties like molecular energies, much mork work needs 
to be done to gurrantee similar levels of accuracy and computational cost for describing molecular response 
properties like polarizabilities and optical rotations. As the name suggests, response properties are related to 
the response or the change induced in the wavefunction in the presence of external electomagnetic fields like visible light.
Simulating response properties like optical rotation is highly desirable as it can help elucidate the structure 
of different chemical species.
%Simulating response properties like optical rotations can be of significant assistance to modern synthetic
%chemists  
% maybe write a line or two about optical rotation as a property, how it can help drug-design research -- just hand-wavy
However, limited applications of the reduced-scaling algorithms to these properties have been shown to yield large and often erratic 
errors. In this work, we identify the reasons behind the unsatisfactory performance of the PNO based reduced-scaling 
approach for calculating response properties at the coupled cluster level of theory 
and propose novel modifications, which we refer to as PNO++, (A. Kumar and T. D. Crawford. Perturbed Pair 
Natural Orbitals for Coupled-Cluster Linear-Response Theory. 2018, {\em manuscript in preparation}) 
which can provide the desired accuracies reliably at significantly lower computational costs than the regular
PNO method. The motivation behind the PNO++ approach came from our works on the (frozen) virtual natural orbitals (FVNO), which can 
be seen as a precursor to the concept of PNOs (A. Kumar and T. D. Crawford. Frozen Virtual Natural Orbitals for 
Coupled-Cluster Linear-Response Theory. {\em J. Phys. Chem. A}, 2017, 121(3), pp 708-716) and the improved 
FVNO++ method (A. Kumar and T. D. Crawford. Perturbed Natural Orbitals for Coupled-Cluster Linear-Response 
Theory. 2018, {\em manuscript in preparation}). The essence of these modified schemes (FVNO++ and PNO++) lie in 
choosing a ``field aware" representation of the wavefunction, which by construction, is much more compact than
their conventional counterparts for calculating response properties. Thus, these schemes are ideal for 
understanding structure-activity relationships of larger and chemically interesting systems like solvated molecules, 
biomolecules, etc., which can eventually assist the the experimental chemists in the process of drug discovery.
